\usage{
shift_forecast(.fcst, fcst_shifts, drop_negative_lead_times = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{.fcst}{A harp_fcst object as created by \link{read_point_forecast}, or
a data frame with columns including 'fcdate' (in seconds) and 'leadtime'
(in hours).}

\item{fcst_shifts}{A named list with names that exist in '.fcst' or a single
numeric value to apply to all forecast models. If a list, each element must
be numeric and of length 1 as only 1 shift can be applied to each forecast.
The shifts are specified in hours. Postive values will shift the forecast
start dates forward in time and reduce the lead times by the corresponding
amounts. Negative values will do the opposite.}
}
\value{
An object of the same class as '.fcst' with the forecast start times
  and lead times shifted for the forecast models and number hours given in
  'fcst_shifts'.
}
\description{
This function is used to shift the start times and lead times of forecasts to
simulate lagging.
